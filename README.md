this bot basically can fetch messages from a discord channel and send them to another discord channel so theyre easier to keep track of. discord doesnt really like this but i dont care. it can track multiple users in a single channel.


to do list for extra functionality that i dont really care about atm:
- [x] fetch command should actually work (it doesnt rn lmao)
- [ ] be able to fetch messages from multiple channels at once
- [x] more error handling for longer messages (longer than 2000 characters breaks the bot currently)
- [x] add links to each message in the output so i can just click them and go to the message
- [ ] be able to add users on the fly rather than coding them into env files
- [ ] be able to add channels on the fly rather than coding them into env files
- [ ] replace userid with username in the no messages found message
- [ ] better attachment handling
- [ ] better code structure we have alot of duplicate code
